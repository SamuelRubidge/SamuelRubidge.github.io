							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am Samuel Rubidge, an aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in coding and a fervor for finance. My career path commenced at a local community college, where I balanced my educational pursuits with a deeply involving internship at a Chicagoland finance company, ultimately paving the way to a full-time role as a Risk Analyst. Throughout this journey, my unwavering passion for coding guided my path toward further growth and innovation. This prompted a significant decision to leave my position and further my abilities at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am presently pursuing a education encompassing Economics, Computer Science, and Data Science, poised to attain my bachelor's degree in the spring of 2024.

								Amidst my academic career, I have dedicated my free hours to developing my coding skills and engaging in project developments that demonstrate my technical acumen and problem-solving capabilities. My evolving skill set reflects a commitment to excellence in software engineering, particularly in Python and Java.
								
								I am now at a juncture where I am seeking opportunities to channel my multifaceted background into a professional role as a software engineer. I am on the lookout for organizations that value innovation, challenge, and personal growth, where I can contribute my expertise and embark on an exciting journey of technological advancement. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I eagerly anticipate the prospect of collaborating with forward-thinking employers who share my vision for excellence in the field of software engineering. Together, we can craft a future where the worlds of people and technology harmoniously intersect, creating lasting impact and transformative solutions.</a></p>

									<h2>Image Based Matchmaker</h2>
									<p>Created for the University of California Santa Barbara's 2020 SB Hacks Hackathon Competition, I collaborated within a team to develop a unique project. Our challenge was to create a program that could predict the probability of love or attraction between two individuals based on photos. To achieve this, through Python we leveraged artificial intelligence APIs to analyze various picture attributes such as attractiveness, mood, age, and gender. This innovative project showcased our creativity and technical skills in combining machine learning and web development to explore the fascinating realm of human connections through the lens of AI-driven image analysis.</p>
